# Using the openQA Log Visualizer

This guide explains how to use the features of the openQA Log Visualizer web interface to analyze and understand complex, multi-machine openQA test runs.

## 1. Starting an Analysis

To begin, you need to provide the URL of an openQA job.

*   **Log URL Input**: Paste any URL from an openQA job's page, like the link to a log file or the main test details page. The tool is smart enough to extract the necessary information (like the server hostname and job ID) from a standard openQA URL.
    *   *Example URL*: `https://openqa.suse.de/tests/18961558/logfile?filename=autoinst-log.txt`

*   **Analyze Button**: Once you've entered the URL, click the "Analyze" button to start the process.

*   **Ignore Cache Checkbox**: By default, the application caches the results of an analysis on your disk to speed up subsequent requests for the same job. The application only caches results for jobs that are in a "done" state. If you want to force a fresh analysis and bypass the cache (e.g., if the job has been re-run), check this box before clicking "Analyze".

## 2. While You Wait

After you start the analysis, the "Job Details" section will display an "Analyzing..." message. The process involves:
1.  Fetching details for the initial job ID.
2.  Discovering and fetching all related parent and child jobs.
3.  Downloading the `autoinst-log.txt` for each job.
4.  Parsing the logs to find key events.
5.  Merging all events into a unified timeline.

This can take anywhere from a few seconds for cached results to a minute or more for complex test suites with many jobs and large logs.

## 3. Navigating the Results

Once the analysis is complete, a floating navigation box will appear in the top-right corner of the page to help you navigate the results:

*   **Expand/Collapse All**: Toggles all the collapsible sections within the "Job Details" area. This is useful for quickly viewing or hiding all the detailed information at once.
*   **â†‘ Top**: Smoothly scrolls the page back to the top.

## 4. Understanding the Output

The results are presented in three main sections: the Merged Timeline, Job Details, and the Debug Log.

### Merged Timeline

![Interacting with the Merged Timeline](../img/MergeTimeline.gif)

This is the most powerful feature of the tool. It provides a single, interactive timeline visualizing the sequence of key events across all discovered jobs.

*   **Lifelines**: Each horizontal line represents a single job, identified by its short name.
*   **Events**: Circles on the lifelines represent key events parsed from the logs. The color of the circle corresponds to the event `type` defined in `config.yaml` (e.g., `mutex`, `barrier`, `error`).
*   **Tooltip**: Hover your mouse over an event circle to see a tooltip with its exact timestamp, the job it belongs to, and the log message.
*   **Click to Highlight**: Click on any event circle. The page will automatically expand the relevant job's "autoinst-log" section and scroll to highlight the corresponding log entry. This is the primary way to correlate a high-level event on the timeline with the specific log line that generated it.
*   **Zooming**: Click and drag horizontally across a section of the timeline to zoom in on that specific time range. A "Reset Zoom" button will appear, allowing you to return to the full view.
*   **Legend**: Below the timeline, a legend dynamically displays all the event types found in the logs and their corresponding colors, helping you to quickly identify different categories of events.

### Job Details

This section contains the detailed information for each job that was part of the analysis.

*   **Job Header**: Each job has a header that includes:
    *   The **Job ID**, which is a direct link to the job's page on the openQA server.
    *   A **short name** for the job, extracted from the full name using the `match_name` regex in the configuration.
    *   The name of the **Parser** from `config.yaml` that was used to process the log.
    *   A **[Cached]** indicator if the data was loaded from the local cache.

*   **Collapsible Sections**: Below the header, details are organized into collapsible sections:
    *   **Settings**: A table of the job's settings from openQA.
    *   **autoinst-log**: A table of the parsed log entries. This is not the full log, but only the lines that matched the patterns defined in the active parser's channels.
    *   **Exceptions**: If any Perl exceptions were found in the log, they are listed here in their entirety.
    *   **Other Details**: A raw JSON view of all other metadata fetched for the job.

*   **Log and Exception Linking**: The `autoinst-log` and `Exceptions` sections are linked.
    *   In the `autoinst-log` table, exception messages are summarized. Clicking on the summary message (which is a link) will jump you to the full exception text in the `Exceptions` section.
    *   In the `Exceptions` section, each exception has a `[Go to log line]` link that will take you back to its summary line in the `autoinst-log` table.

### Debug Log

At the very bottom of the page, this box shows a detailed log of the backend analysis process. It includes information about which jobs were fetched, cache hits/misses, and any errors that occurred. It is primarily useful for troubleshooting the visualizer tool itself.
